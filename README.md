A modular, importable symbolic computation tool for factoring, simplifying, expanding, and integrating trig expressions.

To use in other projects:

- `from integrate.integrator import parser, simplifier, integrator`

To run directly:

- `python integrate/main.py`

## Features

- Trig identity detection and simplification
- Symbolic factoring and expansion
- Integration (indefinite and definite)
- CLI and GUI (via Streamlit)
- Modular structure for reuse in other Python projects

## Usage

### CLI

```
python main.py
```

### GUI

```
streamlit run gui.py
```
